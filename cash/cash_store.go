// for IRL system this probably would replaced by an interface+map in their own module,

// we are also going to do assume the solution is for a single currency (GBP).
// building a general approach would need this structure to be a bit more flexible, since different
// currencies require different denominations, sometime quite funky numbers
// e.g. hungary -> 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000. (500Ft is not stored in ATMs though)
//      trinidad and tobago -> 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 (and usually stores $50 and $100, or often only$100)
